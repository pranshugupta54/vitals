# Hertz

**A native macOS menu-bar system monitor.** CPU, memory, disk, network,
battery, and a live process tree — read straight from the kernel, in one tidy
dropdown.

Tiny, fast, no Electron. ~Few MB of RAM. Built in Swift.

## Install

### Homebrew

```sh
brew install --cask pranshugupta54/tap/hertz
```

or, for the short name afterwards:

```sh
brew tap pranshugupta54/tap
brew install --cask hertz
```

### One-line script

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pranshugupta54/hertz/main/install.sh | bash
```

Either way: the prebuilt app lands in `~/Applications`, launches into your
menu bar, and needs no Xcode and no admin password.

> Hertz is ad-hoc signed (not Apple-notarized). Both installers clear the
> download quarantine for you, so it opens with no Gatekeeper prompt.

## Auto-update

Once installed, Hertz **keeps itself current** — it checks GitHub Releases on
launch and every 24 hours and silently installs new versions. There's also a
manual check in the footer. Nothing to do.

## What it shows

- **CPU** — overall %, a live sparkline, per-core bars, load average, temperature,
  and thermal pressure when macOS reports throttling risk
- **Memory** — pressure, used / free / swap, with a trend graph
- **Disk** — usage donut, free space, live read/write throughput, filesystem
- **Network** — up / down throughput with a trend graph, local IP, Wi-Fi SSID, VPN state
- **Battery** — charge, live power rate, health, cycle count, temperature, adapter wattage,
  plus connected accessories (mouse, keyboard, trackpad)
- **Processes** — a tree grouped by app, with subtree CPU/memory totals,
  sortable by CPU or memory
- **Cleanup Scout** — read-only scan of safe developer caches, with review,
  reveal, report copy, and confirmed cleanup buttons
- **Health score** — a composite 0–100 at a glance
- **Hardware header** — chip, cores, RAM, macOS version, uptime

## How it works

Everything is read directly from the OS — no shelling out, no polling `top`:

| Metric | Source |
| --- | --- |
| CPU / memory | Mach — `host_processor_info`, `host_statistics64` |
| Thermal pressure | Darwin notify — `com.apple.system.thermalpressurelevel` with `ProcessInfo` fallback |
| Processes | `libproc` — `proc_listallpids`, `proc_pidinfo`, `proc_pid_rusage` |
| Disk | `statfs` + IOKit `IOBlockStorageDriver` |
| Battery | IOKit power sources + the `AppleSmartBattery` registry |
| Temperature / fans | the `AppleSMC` user client |
| Network | `getifaddrs` + CoreWLAN |
| Cleanup Scout | FileManager scan of allowlisted user cache paths |

Per-process CPU and memory match Activity Monitor — CPU-time deltas converted
from Mach absolute-time units, memory reported as physical footprint (not RSS).

Cleanup Scout is inspired by Mole's MIT-licensed safety model: review first,
known cache locations only, protected paths refused, and destructive work gated
behind explicit confirmation. Hertz implements its scanner independently in
Swift, with no Mole source copied, and starts with the safest regenerable
developer caches only.

## Requirements

macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later, Apple silicon. Intel Macs can build from source.

## Build from source

Needs the Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pranshugupta54/hertz.git
cd hertz
swift run Hertz          # run it directly
./scripts/bundle.sh      # or build Hertz.app
```

## Uninstall

```sh
brew uninstall --cask pranshugupta54/tap/hertz
```

or, if you used the script installer:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pranshugupta54/hertz/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```
